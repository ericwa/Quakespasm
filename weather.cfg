//lame example weather particles by Spike
//move to id1/particles/weather.cfg
//
//to use from qc, r_particledesc "weather classic" or call particleeffecnum("weather.te_rain") so the engine knows which config to use, then use the particle[rain|snow] builtins as normal.
//without qc changes option 1) use a texture called skyrain or skysnow, in addition to the r_particledesc thing so that this config is actually used (this is more for people to add stuff to existing maps).
//without qc changes option 2) add a worldspawn field called "_texpart_TEXTURENAME" with value "weather.tex_skysnow" or "weather.tex_skyrain"
//without qc changes option 3) an equivelent console command: r_partredirect tex_TEXTURENAME "weather.tex_skysnow"
//note that without qc, you need to restart the map for it to take effect.
//on the other hand, if you wanted to emit particles from models, use r_effect (which can optionally hide those models too).
//to override trails defined by model flags, you can use the r_trail command.
//weather effects that leave decals are probably overkill
//one option is to spawn a particle from qc that emits other particles that leave trails. emitting such trail emitting emitters from surfaces is definitely overkill.

//create another called te_rain_12 or whatever for alternative versions of rain (going by the specified palette)
